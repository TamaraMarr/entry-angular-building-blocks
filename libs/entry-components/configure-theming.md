# Theming Configuration Guide

The `@enigmatry/entry-components` library comes with generator mixin which simplifies project theming by eliminating the need for extensive custom styling. While it comes with default settings, it offers the flexibility to be configured to meet the unique requirements of each project. A wide range of properties can be leveraged to introduce varied style changes when configured appropriately. The guide provides a detailed walkthrough of this process.

#### Prerequisites: 
Ensure that the following library is installed: 
`@enigmatry/entry-form`

### Folder structure

We need separate file for including theme related style files. By our [SCSS coding standard](https://wiki.enigmatry.com/en/standards-and-guidelines/sass-coding-standard) it should be inside `styles/partials/vendors/libraries` subfolder. Create entry subfolder if it isn't already defined in project.The entry subfolder should contain the following SCSS partials:

1. `_index.scss` entry point for mainating good SCSS structure
2. `_general.scss` - Imports necessary library generator files for configuring theming.
3. `_scss-foundation.scss` - imports the scss foundation library

### Include theme-related style files
Within the `general.scss` partial, import the generator file from the library and our custom variables related to the project.

The generator file represents a collection of includes and a mixin that, when used, generates styles for various components based on a combination of a default theme and a custom theme. The generators for each entry component handle the specifics of styling based on the provided theme. You can check which components are supported on the [Components demo](https://entry-demo.enigmatry.com/) application.

In summary, the generator:
- Includes multiple generator files for supported entry components (dialog, table, button, form...)
- Generates [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming) for customization of color pallets, typography, and density settings
- Sets up  default, boilerplate theme with predefined values
- Combines default theme and custom theme styles

```
@use 'entry-components/styles/generator'
@use 'variables' as vars;
```

### Define $custom-theme map 

Next, define the $custom-theme map that will be expanded with various customization options based on specific needs.

```
$custom-theme: ();
```

Include and apply the styles generated by the generate-from mixin in the 'generator' module, using the customization options provided in the $custom-theme map. 

```
@include generator.generate-from($custom-theme);
```

In the end, `general.scss` file should look like this:

```
@use 'entry-components/styles/generator';
@use 'variables' as vars;

$custom-theme: (
);

@include generator.generate-from($custom-theme);
```

###  List of Configuration properties

The new custom-theme map variable should override the default theme that is already defined. It contains a nested structure defining various aspects of a theme. Different key parameters can be passed in to extend it.
